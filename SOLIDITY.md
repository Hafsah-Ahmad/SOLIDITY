                                      SOLIDITY
            Object-oriented, high level programming language for implementing smart contracts.
            -It is a curly brace programming language.
            -Influenced by c++, python and javascript.
            -Supports complex user defined programming, libraries and inheritance.

                                     SOLIDITY VARIABLES
            used to store and manage data within smart contracts.
            - they are fundamental components of any programming language.
            -allows user to change and retrieve the stored information.
            - three different type of variables.
                        ~STATE=(declared inside the functons,only accessible within the scope of function, used for temporary storage)

                        ~LOCAL= (used to store information on the ethereum blockchain, represent long term state of contract, used to store important data)

                        ~GLOBAL= (special variables that are accessible from any contract or function in your solidity smart contract, like msg.sender, Tx.Origin etc)
            
                                 STANDARDS FOR DECLARING VARIABLES
                         
            -Never use reserve keywords as variables like bool, int etc.
            -Shouldn't start with a number.
            -Solidity is case sensitive.
            -use camel casing.
             
                                  SOLIDITY OPERATORS
            symbols or keywords that represent various operations.
            it supports wide range of operators.
            some common tyoes are;
                            -Arithmatic operators
                            -Comparison operators
                            -Logical operators
                            -Bitwise operators
                            -Assignment operators
                            -Conditional operators
                            -Type conversion operators
